# Contributing to Mini Group demo

Thanks for your interest! This repo is a simple demo landing page and local server used to prototype the Mini Group product concept.

How to contribute:
- Fork the repo and open a pull request with a clear description of your change.
- Keep changes focused and backwards compatible.
- For UI changes, include a screenshot or small animated preview.
- Run `npm run start` to test the demo server locally before submitting.

Development notes:
- Static demo data is in `demo/team-buys.json`.
- Simple Express server is `server.js` and serves the demo API at `/api/team-buys`.

Thanks — the goal is to keep this repo approachable and easy to spin up for contributors.
